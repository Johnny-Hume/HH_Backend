# hiker_helper
Backend for Hiker Helper, a webapp aimed at helping Thru Hikers to navigate wildfires.

# Startup
1. pip3 install -r req.txt
2. python3 app.py

# Objectives
1. Develop a robust web application that will actually be used.
2. Build things myself.
   - Using minimal external libraries and pre-built tools, this project will serve to learn the sharp edges and possible pitfalls that libraries make too easy to never learn.
